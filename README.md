# User Guide of a MATLAB Program for Multichannel Filtered Reference Least Mean Square Algorithm

## Introduction
This document explains the implementation of the Multichannel Filtered Reference Least Mean Square (McFxLMS) Algorithm using MATLAB. It's primarily used in adaptive multichannel active noise control applications.

## Theoretical Background
- The McFxLMS algorithm is essential for noise cancellation in complex acoustic environments.
- The document covers the principles and effectiveness of active noise control, emphasizing the algorithm's role.

## Code Explanation
### Key MATLAB Files
- `Control_filter.m`: Defines a class for the control filter of the ANC system.
- `Multichannel_FxLMS.m`: Specifies properties and functions of the multichannel ANC system.
- `Four_MCANC.m`: Main program for testing the McFxLMS algorithm.

### Functions and Their Use
- Initialization functions for setting system properties.
- Functions for generating anti-noise signals and updating filter coefficients.
- Methods for retrieving control filter coefficients.

## Testing and Simulation
- Examples include simulations of a 4-channel collocated ANC system.
- Instructions for setting up primary and secondary paths, generating reference and disturbance signals.

## Conclusion
The guide provides a detailed overview of creating and using a MATLAB program for active noise control using the McFxLMS algorithm.
